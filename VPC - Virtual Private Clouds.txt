VPC - Virtual Private Clouds
A VPC is a computer network ran on the cloud. They are ran in one region and will overlap multiple availability zones. Within the vpc are subnets each subnet will be in an availability zone. We place security groups between subnets and on the vpc to control access to the instance.
CIDR Block is the full block that you have to create all of your networks both private and public subnetworks. VPC CIDR blocks look like 10.0.0.0/16 but thats crazy big. So on average they are more like 10.32.0.0/24 The subnets will be sub sets of of the VPC CIDR block and will look like 10.32.1.0/24 
The resources that are required to be accessed from within the organization as well as from outside of it are kept in a public segment of the network.The segment that logically isolates the resources in a network is called a subnet. Subnet is short for subnetwork. A network is subdivided into multiple logical parts for controlling access to individual logical subparts of the network.
Resources in a network need to communicate with one another, so they need to have a unique identity through which these resources can be distinctly identified and communication can be initiated between them. Such an identity for resources in a network is called an IP address.
A private subnet is a subset of a network wherein resources within a subnet are isolated and restricted for access from within the VPC. Any incoming traffic from the internet cannot directly access the resources within a private subnet. Similarly, outgoing traffic from a private subnet cannot directly access the internet. Outgoing traffic to the internet is either restricted or it is routed through NAT.
